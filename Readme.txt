All tables are presented in Comma-separated values format.

Table 1 - Mass-luminosity relation 
Table 2 - 326 resolved ORB6 binaries with decent agreement of dynamical and photometric masse
Table 3 - Master table containing parallaxes and mass estimates for all 3460 ORB6 entries
Tables 2R and 3R are the updated versions of Tables 2 and 3. Suggestion from the referee allowed to expand list of available third-light companions.

The description of columns is available in the Appendix of the paper.

Tables 2 and 3 are also available via VizieR: http://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/MNRAS/517/2925
Note that column names are modified to meet VizieR requirements. The content and order of columns remains identical.
