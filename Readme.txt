All tables are presented in Comma-separated values format.

Table A1 - Mass-luminosity relation 
Table A2 - 326 resolved ORB6 binaries with decent agreement of dynamical and photometric masse
Table A3 - Master table containing parallaxes and mass estimates for all 3460 ORB6 entries

The description of columns is available in the Appendix of the paper.
